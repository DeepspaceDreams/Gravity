[Deepspace Dreams & Celestial Kicks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/deepspacedreams/) started as a social digging Facebook group. It is now a community composed of people passionnated by music: Djs, producers or simply diggers. 
All those people are animated by the same passion: electronic music tracks specifically characterized by a certain atmospheric vibe, something coming from outer space, from a distant dream. It is the music that us, founder of this sharing space, hold the most dear in our hearts. And although it’s not all that we listen to, it felt necessary to create a space where all the people that feel the same passion as us could go and share their findings. 
Deep Techno, Ambient, Dub Techno, but also Drum'n'Bass, Noise and many more, those are genres where we can find a lot of pads and textures, and this “deepspace” quality. To understand a bit more what are deepspace tracks, we invite you to check the tracks reposted on our [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/deepspace-dreams) or the labels and podcasts suggested in our [database](http://deepspacedreams.com/database/). 

Thriving from this community and this common passion, the Deepspace Dreamers decided to take things to the next level. 
With this project we want to share with the rest of the world what we characterize as Deepspace Music. 
To this end, we are launching a podcast channel, and each podcast will be accompanied short stories about space, science fiction, dystopia etc. The writers will take their inspiration from the deepspace music created by the artist in the podcast, thus creating a chain of inspiration, from music to writing. 
Other projects are in consideration, so stay posted. 

To follow our deepspace journey, you can check our [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/deepspace-dreams) were you can find our podcasts and all the soundcloud tracks posted on our group and our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx6qpL85eEaqOAb0hz5N66w) were you can find our playlists. 

On this website, you will find the writings of our authors either accompanied by a playlist or a podcast, the [playlists](http://deepspacedreams.com/playlists/) created by the community, and our [database](http://deepspacedreams.com/database/) were we link all the deepspace music resources the various labels and channels have to offer us.
