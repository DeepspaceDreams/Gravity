This is our first Takeover day featuring Drum'n'Bass gems straight from deepspace.

Drum'n'Bass is considered as Jungle's child and features a very large set of sub-genres including halfstep or drumfunk. Among these subgenres, you might find some very deep tracks that might change the way you see Drum'n'Bass.

You'll find some very obscure tracks from labels like Hidden Hawaii, as well as tracks from widely popular artists like Noisia or event Current Value who's usually well known for his very "in your face", noisy and electronic groove.

We hope you'll enjoy it.
