C'est un test ok 

For our first community label day, we chose to focus on the vinyl-only Giegling and its sub-labels, Forum and Traumprinz.

Definitely one the most prolific label in terms of quality and quantity over the last year, Giegling successfully manages to continuously create and share deep and meaningful techno while keeping low profile on its communication, yet each release is quickly sold-out, sometimes even before being announced by regular medias. 

For more Giegling digging, check their [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/fr/label/144751-Giegling).
