After digging Bright Ambient, we chose to dig its counterpart, Dark Ambient, sub-genre of Ambient also known as ambient industrial / post-industrial.

Artists/projects like Eno, Lustmord, Nocturnal Emissions and others were behind its creation. 
Then came many as Raison D'etre, OÃ¶phoi, Robert Rich, Demdike Stare, Empusae, Ionosphere, Godspeedyou ...
Some labels: Cold Spring, Soleilmoon, Side Effects, Sterile, Sound Source, Cold Meat Industry, Yantra Atmospheres, Ant-zen, Modern Love, Posh Isolation ...
