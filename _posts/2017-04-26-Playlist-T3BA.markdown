For the third takeover day, we chose to focus on Ambient Music, and particularly bright ambient, aka super boring elevator music, aka the gift of God. Ambient appeared in the UK after the first synthesizers, influenced by artists such as Mike Oldfiel, Vangelis, and Erik Satie, considered like the first composer of ambient music. It was then popularized by Brian Eno (Ambient 1-4 on Editions EG), Robert Fripp ...

Brian Eno seems to have given a name and a definition to Ambient, a sound surrounding the person listening to it without necessarily taking all its attention from him (like Music for Airports). 

I will name a few labels, but there is more: Music70, Warp Records, Skam, Mille Plateaux, VCO Records, Ecstatic, Emotional Response, Subtext, Posh Isolation, 2062, Raster-Noton ...
