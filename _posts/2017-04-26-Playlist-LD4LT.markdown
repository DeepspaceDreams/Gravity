For our fourth community label day, we chose the UK based label Lobster Theremin. 

Youngish label founded in 2013, it nevertheless remains (very) prolific with new releases on an almost weekly basis. An unremitting rhythm creating a very eclectic catalog: lo-fi, dub techno, drum'n'bass, electro, ambient, in short the lobster is not being stingy in its music publication, with names now sounding like rising stars or even already well-established artists of the genres in which they evolve, such as nthng, Sweely, Palms Trax or Route 8.

2017 might even be the year of lobster on the techno calendar, since the label has just opened its own record store in London receiving music lovers 7 days a week and published a few solid releases, such as It Never Ends, by nthng a well-known producer for musical astronauts.
