For the second takeover day, we chose to focus on the deep, soft and crunchy sonorities of \*praises\* Dub Techno.

Dub Techno appeared with labels such as Basic Channel / Chain Reaction with Von Oswald and Ernestuset. Many artists showed a lot of talent, like Rob Modell alias Deepchord and Echospace, Porter Ricks alias Mellwig&k√∂ner, Robert Henke alias Helical Scan Monolake, Gerard Hanson alias Convextion alias E.R.P etc. etc.
