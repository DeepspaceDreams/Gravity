[DDCK Tools](https://github.com/DeepspaceDreams/ddck-tools) is a small set of JavaScript tools made to make social digging group management easier. They've been developed for our own needs and we decided to share them to the community.

These tooks allow you to gather weekly stats about the posts on your group to get an overview of the group's activity over a week but also it enables you to extract links in posts that have been flagged with a given keyword in order to automatically extract links from a label day for example.

Feel free to use them and check out [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/DeepspaceDreams).
