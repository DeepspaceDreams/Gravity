For this second label day, we chose an obvious deepspace label: Northern Electronics, as well as their sub-label, Blod√∂rn.

Created in 2013 by Adbulla Rashim and based in Stockholm, the swedish record label represents a music that is particularly linked to what we believe to be deepspace music: atmospheric tracks with lots of pads that transport us to northern landscapes, under the northern lights. With releases oscillating between techno and a more ambient/experimental electronic music, Northern Electronics gathers resident producers that are perfect figures for this atmosphere: Acronym, Varg, SARS and Korridor.
